    <!-- =======================================================================
         A quickstart pom.xml that creates a sample project that uses ANTLR 3.x
         grammars. You should replace the sample grammars in src/main/antlr3
         with your own grammar files and use packages.

         A .g file in
          
            src/main/antlr3/com/temporalwave

          belongs in the package
          
            com.temporalwave

         See http://antlr.org/antlr3-maven-plugin for more details.

         This project produces both a jar file of the project and an executeable
         jar file that contains all the dependencies so you can run it standalone.
         See below for more details.

    Tell Maven which other artifacts we need in order to

    goal be install so that you can just type mvn at the command
    line instead of mvn install. And we add the java compiler plugin
    for convenience to show how you can use 1.6 source files but
    generate 1.4 compatible .class files (as few people seem to
    know about the jsr14 target).

              Strictly speaking, we did not need to generate this for you from
              the prototype, but we use it to illustrate how you can get
              the JDK 6 Java compiler to accept 1.5 or 1.6 targeted source code
              but produce class files that are compatible with JRE 1.4. As
